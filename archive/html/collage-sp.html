                <h4>Drawing from my firsthand experience in São Paulo, I aim to reflect on the stark contrast between the city's vibrant culture and the harsh realities of its marginalized communities. The collage is shaped into <strong>São Paulo's map</strong>, which serves as a visual narrative that highlights the city's dual nature: a <strong>dynamic urban identity</strong> overlaying persistent <strong>socioeconomic struggles</strong>.</h4>

            <h5>One of Brazil’s most pressing societal challenges lies in its infamous slums, also referred to as favelas. These neighborhoods emerged much like slum communities worldwide, as rural populations migrated to cities in search of opportunities, only to find themselves confined to makeshift housing on the fringes of urban life. Over time, this cyclical poverty has become deeply embedded within the society, passing from one generation to the next with little hope of escape.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>The following video by Vox delves into the history and social dynamics of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, a major city in Brazil.</h5>

            <h5>Having lived in São Paulo, also one of Brazil’s largest cities, for four years, I had the unique opportunity to observe the favela communities up close. As someone who grew up in a vastly different environment in South Korea, I was struck by the juxtaposition between the large, vibrant murals and the impoverished homes they covered. The colorful wall paintings seemed to mask the harsh realities beneath, creating an irony that lingered in my mind.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>This work serves to reflect that contradiction. By collaging images of favelas into the shape of São Paulo’s map, I aimed to capture the duality of this city: its vibrancy contrasted with the systemic issues that perpetuate poverty. From a distance, the colorful composition celebrates the unique identity of São Paulo. Yet upon closer inspection, the fragmented houses reveal the city’s deeper struggles, communicating the inescapable cycle that defines life in the favelas.</h5>
